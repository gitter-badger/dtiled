Use structs instead of classes when possible
Use unions for things like data/objects on maplayer
Use guid property to return guid with top bits zeroed
nest types: allow access to outer context for mapping guids to tile data
What is the difference between flipH | flipV and flipDiagonal?
Tests: show index that mismatched when asserting on ranges.
